<h1>KaYesu Machayo</h1>
<h4><br>
Hello! My name is KaYesu, and I'm a freshman double majoring in computer science and 
business at The George Washington University.  I am a first generation American, my mom is from Uganda and my dad is from Kenya.
<br><br>
This summer, I am working for Girls Who Code as an Operations Specialist (remotely) and Campus TA at Georgetown Day School.
<br><br>
After graduating from high school in June 2017, I took a gap year. During my gap year, I lived and interned in South Philadelphia, Uganda, and did an entrepreneurship and leadership training at the University of Ottawa. For the first semester of my gap year, I lived in Philadelphia and worked as a STEM Teacher's Assistant for a community school and taught 100 students from over 32 countries worldwide, many of them refugees and immigrants. For the second semester of my gap year, I lived in Mbarara, Uganda for several months, doing a research internship at Mbarara University of Science and Technology. I worked closely with Dr. Angella, the head of the Computer Science department at the university. During my time in Uganda, I developed the University’s International Affairs webpage, worked to implement interventions to inspire rural Ugandan girls to pursue STEM, and led STEM talks for secondary school girls with an aim of teaching the girls about the importance of pursuing their STEM passions. I also worked for Mbarara University's Girls in STEM project and began developing a reflective journal for the school girls. I was able to visit two girls’ schools during my time in Uganda. I visited Kyebambe Girls School in Fort Portal and St. Mary's Girls School in Mbarara, Uganda, and there I had open dialogue seminars with the girls about my story, their stories, and our hopes for the future.
I paid for this gap year entirely by using scholarships.
